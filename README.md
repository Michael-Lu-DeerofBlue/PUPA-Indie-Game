# PUPA-Indie-Game
These are some parts of codes and assets I wrote and designed for our Indie game: PUPA High School. The project is done in my high school senior year, with self-taught Unity and C#, so the codes seem as elegant as those I programmed after I got into Swarthmore College and learned CS systematically.

The game is now released on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2007790/_PUPA/
