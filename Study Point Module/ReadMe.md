This is a folder containing the codes and UI for the Study Point Interface I designed and programmed in our game PUPA. This is the place where the player can check their levels in the subject they chose to study. The higher the levels they get, the more buff they have in the next round of test and gameplay, and vice versa. This is a part of the positive/negative feedback loop we designed.
